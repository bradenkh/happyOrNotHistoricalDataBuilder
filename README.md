# happyOrNotHistoricalDataBuilder

It's not very often we have the opportunity to write something from ground zero. I built an application that was used as a feedback tool for Brigham Young University Idaho on their website.
This small program was used to move the data from the old application to the new one.

You can see the new tool in the wild here:

It is the feedback tab on the left side.
